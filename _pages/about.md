    We present the Fine-Grained Task Planning (FGTP) framework, which uses object ontology and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create detailed action plans. FGTP processes text and images to understand object attributes and uses logic-based reasoning to find alternatives if tasks fail. Tests in VirtualHome and with the TIAGo robot confirm its effectiveness.

    We introduce a dataset of household objects' properties and relationships, along with a graph-based model combining GAT and BERT to predict these relationships. Using a Transformer framework, our approach improves robots' ability to organize objects by accurately predicting their relationships.
