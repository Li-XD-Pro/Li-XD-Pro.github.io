excerpt: 'In domestic environments, traditional robot object organization focuses on individual properties, neglecting placement order. We present a dataset capturing household objects' properties and relationships, along with a graph-based model that combines Graph Attention Network (GAT) and BERT to predict these relationships. Using a Transformer framework, we trained a model to infer object relationships, improving robots' ability to organize household items effectively.'
